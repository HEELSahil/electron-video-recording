## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HEELSahil/video-recording-app.git
   cd video-recording-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```

3. **Configure Electron (if needed):**

   Ensure the `main` field in your `package.json` is set to your Electron entry point (e.g., `"main": "main.js"`).


### Running the App

#### Development Mode (Browser & Electron)

1. **Start Next.js Dev Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start Electron:**

   In another terminal window, run:

   ```bash
   npm run electron
   ```

The Electron window will load your Next.js app. You can also open the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for testing.


## Usage
